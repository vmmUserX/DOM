Depth of Market
There is an old riddle: "How to dance with a 500-pound gorilla?" Answer: "Any way she wants".
   Any day you will see an active market makers. You need to know what they are doing. Whether they buy or sell at a certain price level? Do buying and selling with your own accounts or record transactions in the accounts of their customers? If the market makers take for themselves what they want to buy at a low price and sell high. This means that the purchase of the Instrument are on the bid (Buy Limit), and sales - ask (Sell Limit). As a rule, market makers buy when the market is down (Buy Limit) and sell (Sell Limit) when the market goes up, then there are the counterparty of the transaction. 
   With the advent of new technologies, a detailed study of the tape is gradually transformed into a field of study clusters. The cluster volume is, in fact, the aggregate value of the volume within a calculation period.
